# Ochetgenyo

Decorate your walls with an ancient language

## About

This mod adds blocks an items to construct sentences in **Ochetgenyo**, a language long lost.

To get started, craft **Glyph Base** blocks, upon which you can write the language's script. You can either use a stonecutter to create individual blocks, or craft a **Glyph Chisel** to easily cycle through all the symbols!

### Additional Features

- You can use any dye on a glyph block; they all have unique color palettes!
- Use a Glow Ink Sac on a glyph block to make it shine when it's dark
- Shift-right-click a vowel glyph with the Glyph Chisel to turn it left or right
- Placing new glyphs below existing ones will copy the color and glowing status from above
    - This also applies to glyphs created with the Glyph Chisel
- Shift-right-click a glyph block with an empty hand to display the full vertical sentence in chat

## Language

Ochetgenyo is a **conlang**, or constructed language, with very little defined content. There are words and grammar rules you can follow, but feel free to mess around with it however you'd like!

To learn more about the language and potentially contribute to its development, see the [Language Info](https://github.com/acikek/ochetgenyo/blob/1.19/INFO.md) page.
