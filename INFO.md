# Info

This page details the language of Ochetgenyo and how one might use it in your Minecraft world.

## Overview

Ochetgenyo has a vertically written and connected script which is read top-down and then left-to-right. Its alphabet is very limited in its phonetic inventory, but its structure allows it to represent a wide range of ideas.

## Glyphs

Each letter represents a sound in the [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), with the only dissimilarity between English being the consonant `j`, which is the English consonant `y`.

Consonant glyphs do not connect to other consonants, only to vowels. Vowels connect to all glyphs and are only unattached when completely on their own.<br>
The only exception is the consonant `j`, which connects like a vowel *except* after `t`.

The digraph `tj` becomes `/t É/` (english "ch" sound) - this is a very common evolution of `/tj/`.

The "Stop" glyph does not connect to anything; it represents the end of a sentence or thought.

## Vocabulary and Grammar

Ochetgenyo has very little defined content at the moment. The main draw of the mod is the script, but a more comprehensive grammar and vocabulary might one day be created; feel free to contribute some on your own!

For now, here are some basic words and grammar concepts.

### Basic Words

- **tjo**: I, me
- **akte**: you
- **go**: it
- **onkjo go**: they (singular), someone
- **enjo**: we, us
- **najo**: they (plural)
- **a**: and
- **o**: one, one of
- **e**: *negation marker*
- **na**: *plural marker*
- **as, an**: a
- **es, en**: the
- **atje**: person
- **osak**: bread
- **pen**: good
- **etjen**: bad

### Verbs

Verbs follow a mostly-standard format, with a few individual irregularities here and there. Infinitives have a **stem** with an `e` suffix at the end. For example:
- to be: ke'e (stem: *ke*)
- to speak: ote (stem: *ot*)
- to eat: pongete (stem: *ponget*)

To conjugate these verbs in the present indicative, use the suffix chart below:

| Singular | Plural |
|----------|--------|
| -j       | -s     |
| -vo      | N/A**  |
| -a*      | -na    |

*Replace the ending vowel, if any
**Exact same as 3rd-person-plural

When a variation of 'a' or 'the' follows a conjugation of a verb and they share a leading/following vowel, they get combined.<br>
For example: "onkjo go ka as atje" -> "onkjo go **kas** atje" - They are a person.

### Adjectives

Permanent adjectives precede the noun while temporary adjectives follow it. Subjectivity is not taken into account; both kinds of adjectives can be subjective or objective.<br>
For example: "es **pen osak etjen** tjo e pongej" - I'm not eating the __rotten__ (temporary) __sweet__ (permanent) bread.

Adjectives usually end in a consonant, so disregarding proper nouns, it's fairly easy to tell when a word is an adjective.

### Sentence Structure

The sentence structure of Ochetgenyo differs depending on the medium. While spoken, it can be OSV or VSO depending on the intonation. However, in writing, it's *whatever looks best*. As you might imagine, this is very subjective, but it also gives the author a lot more creative freedom.

## In-Game Romanization

When you shift-right-click a glyph, the entire vertical sentence is displayed in chat. However, you might find that some segments have changed; for example, `tj` becomes `ch` and `j` becomes `y`.

The preferred romanization style is transliteration, meaning that for the player's convenience, these segments have been swapped for a more readable and familiar format geared towards English speakers.
